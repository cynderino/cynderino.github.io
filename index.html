  <p>I am a Program/Project Manager at Sprint for the 1Million Project. I am responsible largely for device and inventory management, 1MP Applicant and District support lines as well as various other operational support activities.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my three kids, coaching my son’s baseball and flag football teams as well as playing recreational sports myself. I live in Overland Park with my boyfriend, Rob and my two youngest children, Mary (15yrs) and Jonah (10yrs). My oldest daughter, Chloe, is a Junior at KU.</p>
